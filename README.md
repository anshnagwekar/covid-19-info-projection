# COVID-19 Advanced Information Projection

This small project was a few scripts I wrote that read in the latest COVID19 Case and Death count (link: https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) in American states and counties.
Scripts include:
* First/latest case/death in any county/state
* Case/death growth on any given day in any county/state
* Case/death total on any given day in any county/state
* County/State with most cases/death growth on any given date
* County/State with most cases/death total on any given date
* Graph of Case/Death progression (using Python matplotlib) between any two dates
* Total growth of cases/deaths in any county/state between two dates
